/* This is a very basic, and not comfortable, step sequencer, made for demostrating
   editing capabilities of the jdksmidi library. It creates an AdvancedSequencer class instance,
   gets it MultiTrack, and allow the user to edit it.
   You can load and save MIDI files, play them, view the file content, edit the file.
   You can insert, delete or change these MIDI events: note, control (in particular volume and pan)
   patch and tempo. For changing an event, insert a new event (same note, control, patch, tempo) at
   same time position.
