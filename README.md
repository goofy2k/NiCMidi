# MYJDKMIDI MIDI library		{#mainpage}
### by Nicola Cassetta

Myjdkmidi was originarially a fork of J. D. Koftinoff jdksmidi (\ref https://github.com/jdkoftinoff/jdksmidi).
I initially tried to enhance the library, revising code and adding some function, but later I realized I
couldn't mantain the same interface.
